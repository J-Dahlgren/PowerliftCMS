## Inital access

As previously mentioned, the software is based around the client/server paradigm. This means that you need to have the IP of the machine the software is running on. Open your web browser on the same machine you're running the application on and go to "localhost" or "localhost:YOUR_PORT_NUMBER" if you've changed the port number from the default (80).

### Finding the IP

The IP should be visible on the front page of Power Comp. This number is what you should use when connecting to the application from other machines on the same network.

## Layout

The user interface has 3 main components: Menu bar, Side nav, and Content container

### Menu bar

The menu bar is located at the top and is visible most of the time, it is hidden automatically when navigating to any of the [displays](displays).

Pressing the 'menu' button will open/close the side nav

Pressing **CTRL + space** will hide/show the menu.

### Side nav

Pressing **CTRL + Q** will hide/show the side nav.

Clicking on the the items in the side nav will make the application navigate to the corresponding feature which is displayed in the content container.
