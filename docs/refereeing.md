## Input
Any input device can be used for decisions that comply with the following:
 - The device is a [HID keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class).
 - It sends its information as keyboard presses ([ASCII characters](http://www.asciitable.com/)).

This makes it possible to create controllers on you own, e.g. with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and their [HID library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/keyboard/).

The judge numbers are from left to right, from the audience point of view.
